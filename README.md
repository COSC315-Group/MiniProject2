# MiniProject2: Threads and Synchronization 
Outline of what we did for the assignment/summary

## Design Choices
Explain the design of your program and how syncronization works. Keep it short and to the point.

figures etc


## Getting Started/Build Instructions
Getting started in C: the program is compiled already but if you make changes and would like to see it ran do the following
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Use the pthread flag with gcc to compile this code: ~$ gcc -pthread producer-consumer.c -o producer-consumer
3. Now using the name you placed in gcc after -o type ./producer-consumer to start the program

Getting started in Java:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Use Javac inside your src/project folder as `Javac *.java` to compile the java code into class files
4. To run the program go out to te src/ folder and type `java project.Run` this will run the program which will begin prompting you
