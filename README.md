# MiniProject2: Threads and Syncronization 
Outline of what we did for the assignment/summary

## Design Choices
Explain the design of your program and how syncronization works. Keep it short and to the point.

figures etc


## Getting Started/Build Instructions
build instructions stating exactly how to compile your code on the Linux for both the Java and C/C++ implementations. Preferably, these will be in the form of Makefiles. 

File should contain run instructions stating exactly how to execute your compiled code on the Linux.for both the Java and C/C++ implementations. These instructions should include a description of any command line arguments your program expects or accepts. If your program prints a usage message, then it is sufficient to say how to get your program to print that message. If max request duration or producer sleep time can only be adjusted by editing your source code, those values should be global variables and you must state their locations in your code.

## If the code doesnt work
If your implementation does not work, you should also document the problems in the README, preferably with your explanation of why it does not work and how you would solve it if you had more time.Of course, you should also comment your code. We can'tgive you credit for something we don't understand!
